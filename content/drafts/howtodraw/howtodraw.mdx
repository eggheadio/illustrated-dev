# How Did You Learn to Illustrate?

Outline:
- Square 1: 22 years old, Anthropology degree in hand. "I need some employable skills" > Web design + illustration
- Square 2: Move back to Vietnam (renting a cupboard-room keeps living costs under $200pm and gives me a huge time advantage). // Maybe don't include this? Personal context not that important.
- Square 3: Design a system. Morning hours (5.30-8). Tracking sheets. Beeminder time logging.

The System
- Beeminder, Toggle, Python Script
- Dribbble (back when it was good)

The Source Material
(Build a bookshelf React component! Cover, authors, titles. With hovers & links!)
- Books: Loomis, Scott Robertson

Seperate but related post on the embedded illustrator and treating illustration as the communication medium, not the message.

- Anthropology degree / that's great you like art but study other things in tandem with it.
- Illustration skills alone lead to obsessive craft-focused-navel-gazing. Illustration skills + complimentary expertise is the right formula.
