## Part Four - Playful Remixing

Now that we have some interesting ingredients on the page we get to start playing.

I use these all interchangeably, but there's no _one true way_. For this post I'm just going to focus on my favourite – SCAMPER

Maximise or minimise
Eliminate
Put to other uses
Rearrange or reverse

Here's some more tangible examples of each

### Substitute

Keyboard keys for castle bricks

### Combine

HTTPS letters for padlock dials

### Adapt


### Maximise or Minimize

### Put to Other Uses

### Eliminate

Now our brainstorming page is expanding.

Let's pull out some of the more interesting sketches and how they're using SCAMPER (or not)

While running through these remix exercises I'm also thinking of all these as "mini-scenes"
Or perhaps "visual stories"

Each of these has a character, doing an action, in a scene.
So the web browser and the aggressive click icons are the characters, doing the action of x, in the landscape of the internet,

## Judgement Day

Now comes the tough part – looking at the sprawl of bad ideas and make hard judgements about what ones are actually worth pursuing as propser solutions to the problems
