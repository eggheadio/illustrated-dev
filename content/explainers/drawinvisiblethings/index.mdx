Drawing invisible things is the best and worst job.

This is a case study showing the process of illustrating a course.

Every egghead course gets a big main course illustration.
Like this and this and this

They are _always_ on topics that are:  
a) fundamentally asbtract  
b) haven't been around long enough for our culture to develop a set of meaningful icons and visual symbols for them.

**Which certainly makes my job interesting.**

Try, for a moment to imagine what "Ansychronous Programming in RxJS" visually looks like.

Or "Dependency Injection in Angular"

Or just "Monads"

I expect many people will be here hoping to learn what pixel size I set my #EAEFF1 brush to in order to careful render a diffuse light across a relfective metallic surface in Photoshop CC 2020 on a 15-inch Macbook Pro 2015 hooked up to a Wacom Cintiq 22HD running OS Catalina 10.15.1.

This is not that blog post. 1

## Part One – What are we doing?

The guinea pig in this walkthrough is [Mike Sherov]()'s upcoming course Web Security Essentials

It is good to make obvious that "Web Security" is not a single, physical, made-of-atoms object in the world.

Thus begins our problem.

#### How do you draw a thing that's not a thing?

Good question.  
Capturing the essence of any historically-constructed, fuzzy-edged, evolving cultural concept like "Web Security", or "The inner workings of quantitative easing in financial markets," or just "Teamwork" is ....

The best answer is **Metaphor**

My job is less about drawing lines and picking colours than it is about designing and building metaphors 

Finding the right visual metaphor is a going to be a glorious scavenger hunt through language, iconography, and cultural association.

## Part Two – Scavenger Hunting

Our first order of business is getting a grip on what this course is about.
