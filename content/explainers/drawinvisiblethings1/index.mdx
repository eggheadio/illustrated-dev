Drawing invisible things is both the best and worst job.   
It's equal parts intellect and craft - it lives in the awkward in-between space of creative intuition and technical know how.

For the last four years I've been doing it full time at [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/).  
As the art director and lead illustrator I'm the one in charge of all the shiny pictures you'll see around the site:

These images are all course illustrations - essentially album art for our workshops. <Tooltip tiptext={<span>I don't make all of our illustrations  – I have a wonderful team that includes <a href="#">Maxime</a> and <a href="#">Aleksander</a> who help with the load.</span>}>1</Tooltip>

We teach web development topics, which means the particular flavour of invisible things I draw are programming concepts, techniques, frameworks, and tools.

This poses some unique visual challenges.  

Our topics are _always_:  
a) fundamentally abstract  
b) haven't been around long enough for our culture to develop a set of meaningful icons and visual symbols for them

**Which certainly makes my job interesting.**

Try, for a moment to imagine what "[Typescript with React](https://egghead.io/courses/use-typescript-to-develop-react-applications)" visually looks like.  
Or "[A Server-rendered ReactJS Application with Next.js](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-server-rendered-reactjs-application-with-next-js)".  
Or the "[State Monad in JavaScript](https://egghead.io/courses/state-monad-in-javascript)"

This is a long overdue case study showing how I go about illustrating one of our courses.

It has numerous parts:



[map of the outline]
[timeline map of he stages of an illustration we're going to walk through - research section. Stating the mission (single point), declaring keywords, building word lists and visual symbols, lateral thinking and playing around, judging yourself, making choices, refining composition, value structure and colour mocks (same step), *enter automatic pilot mode*, video recording of adobe illustrator vector base, vector refining, export to photoshop, painting in photoshop.]

So far I've made xxx of these over the last 4 years and can reasonably say I know a little about how to do this.

## Part One – What are we doing?

The guinea pig in this walkthrough is [Mike Sherov]()'s upcoming course Web Security Essentials

Whenever you're starting a design challenge of any kind – illustration, app, carbon capture technology – it's a good idea to make the challenge you're facing nice and clear. So let's write ourselves a challenge statement.

_We want to create an illustration that clearly communicates the idea of "Web Security"_

It is good to make obvious that "Web Security" is not a single, physical, made-of-atoms object in the world.

Thus begins our problem.

# How do you draw a thing that's not a thing?

Good question.  
Capturing the essence of any historically-constructed, fuzzy-edged, evolving cultural concept like "Web Security" is a fascinating challenge.

Drawing well is difficult in its own right. Making a dog look like a dog or hand look like a hand requires a lot of training, practice and patience. 
There's a whole extra layer to the challenge when you don't even know what that _thing_ is yet.

Good meaningful illustration works on three layers - conceptual metaphor, clear visual communication, and - making it look cool. 
A whole lot of people ask how to making things look cool. Which is a legitimate desire. I am very into making shit look cool.

In fact a significant number of few people will be here hoping to learn what pixel size I set my #EAEFF1 brush to in order to careful render a diffuse light across a reflective metallic surface in Photoshop CC 2020 on a 15-inch Macbook Pro 2015 hooked up to a Wacom Cintiq 22HD running OS Catalina 10.15.1.

<SmallCenter>

This is not that blog post. <Tooltip tiptext={<span>If you would like to learn how, take <a href="">Sam Neilson's Fundamentals of Lighting</a> on Schoolism. It will drown you in the minutiae of rendering light on surfaces.<br />Also check out the <a href="https://illustrated.dev/resources">Resources</a> page.</span>}>2</Tooltip>

This is instead about Metaphors. Specifically, **Visual Metaphors**.

While much of my work does involve drawing shapes correctly and picking nice colours and rendering lighting effects, those are very much the top layer of the illustration cake. Visual metaphors are the base.

![Illustration of a layered cake with metaphor on the bottom, good drawing foundations in the middle, and colours with pretty lighting effects on the top. And a cherry representing whatever photoshop brush I'm using to make these](./cake.png)

## What's a Metaphor?

The first step to getting good at visual metaphor is understanding what it is.

![Diagram of intangible fuzzy thing through the frame of a physical object](./metaphor.jpeg)

Conceptual metaphor is the basis of how we draw every single non-literal object. Drawing an orange is fairly straight forward. Drawing anything non-physical abstract __thing__ – freedom, financial crashes, racial tension, teamwork, speculation, database management, capitalism, productivity – all relies on metaphor.

## Internet Metaphors

Since we're working in the land of the internets, it's important to make clear the fundamental metaphors we think about digital things with - *cyberspace*

Everything I illustrate builds off a set of assumptions we make about the physical shape of the digital world.

To start with we think the internet is a landscape we move through. We visit / go to websites. Follow links.

It's strangely also a stack of paper. Which might seem odd but it's an example of *blended metaphor* which were all very good at.

[diagram of the internet being above us, future to the right, backwards to the left, the desktop is a desk in front of us, websites are paper documents, cards are the size and shape of playing cards, changing state is movement , the internet is a physical space we move through, ... show examples of this on some of your work. Paper, clouds]

Finding the right visual metaphor is a going to be a glorious scavenger hunt through language, iconography, and cultural association.

### Let's look at these again

Part of getting good at visual metaphors is explicitly realising when you're seeing one and working backwards to break down how it's working.

_{Do cake breakdowns of the three egghead illos in a carousel-like set of arrow images. You click through and different cake layers highlight. Makes explicit the conceptual metaphor layer (CSS styles control how specific areas of a website look. abstract away concept of "thing that selects individual areas to change their visual appearance". Could be paint confined to an area - paint by numbers) the clear visual communication layer(image references, clear composition), and the making it look cool layer (point out nice colour palette, light effects)_

_Vue-router - metaphor that routers move you from one area of a website to another. Websites are physical locations we physically move through.}_

CSS selectors = picking specific architectural elements of a house to colour in with a historical throwback to the Sims 2 UI

Redux-actions = video game controllers

Vue-router = an underground railway system. Pages in an app are stations.

I know this is a little like telling a joke, and then explaining why the joke was funny. It kind of sucks the fun out of it. But breaking down the visual metaphors behind visuals is one of the best ways I've found to getting better at thinking in them.

You want to backwards engineer how the image works.

I do this every time I see a terribly clever editorial piece on a news or media site, and keep a giant collection of them for reference.

## Let's Get Analytical

Here's a handful of editorial illustration whose work I admire:
