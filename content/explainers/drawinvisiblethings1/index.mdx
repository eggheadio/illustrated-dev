This is a long, overdue case study showing how I make an <Link to="https://egghead.io/">egghead</Link> course illustration.

It spans everything from <Link to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_metaphor">cognitive metaphor theory</Link> to Photoshop rendering so I hope you have a hot, caffienated beverage with you.

<Center>It also comes numerous parts:</Center>

## An Introduction

If anyone is new here, hello and welcome!  
I'm <Link to="http://maggieappleton.com/">Maggie</Link> and I make all the things on this site.

For the last half decade I've also been the art director & lead illustrator over at <Link to="https://egghead.io">egghead</Link>.

We're a company / website / collection of humans who teach web development through a mix of tutorial videos, articles, illustrated notes, workshops, and whatever other medium we feel like.  
As you might expect, it's a whole lot of JavaScript, React, GraphQL, Vue, classic HTML & CSS, and other internety technologies.

My job involves taking all those abstract, hard-to-explain programming concepts and making them visible in a way that helps people understand them. Sometimes through illustrated notes, or animations, or diagrams, or interpretive dance on zoom calls.

One part of that work is making _**course illustrations**_, which are like album artwork for all the courses we publish.  <Tooltip tiptext={<span>I don't make all of our illustrations  – I have a wonderful team that includes <a href="#">Maxime</a> and <a href="#">Aleksander</a> who help with the load.</span>}>1</Tooltip>

<Center>Here's a few of them...</Center>

So far I've made over 150 of these things and I'm almost beginning to think I what I'm doing. <Tooltip tiptext='Only in course illustrations, definitely not in life.'>2</Tooltip>


<!-- That includes everything from making cover illustrations for every course we release, drawing illustrating notes (eg. everything on this website), and animating helpful diagrams. I've been doing it for half a decade now and am almost starting to think I know what I'm doing. -->

## Part Zero – What are we doing?

The guinea pig in this walkthrough is going to be <Link to="https://twitter.com/mikesherov">Mike Sherov</Link>'s course on <Link to="https://egghead.io/courses/web-security-essentials?af=54fd64">Web Security Essentials</Link>.

Whenever you're starting a design challenge of any kind – illustration, innovative sandwich recipe, carbon capture technology – it's a good idea to make the challenge you're facing nice and clear.  
So let's write ourselves a challenge statement.

_**We want to create an illustration that clearly communicates the idea of "Web Security"**_

At this point it's good to make obvious that "Web Security" is not a single, physical, made-of-atoms object in the world.

Thus begins our problem.

# How do you draw a thing that's not a thing?

How do you take a historically-constructed, fuzzy-edged, evolving cultural concept like "Web Security," and draw it?

It's a good question.
One I've been obsessed with for a while.

Capturing the essence of any  is a fascinating challenge.

Programming in particular poses some unique visual challenges.  

Our topics are _always_:  
a) fundamentally abstract  
b) haven't been around long enough for our culture to develop a set of meaningful icons and visual symbols for them

Try, for a moment to imagine what "[Typescript with React](https://egghead.io/courses/use-typescript-to-develop-react-applications)" visually looks like.  
Or "[A Server-rendered ReactJS Application with Next.js](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-server-rendered-reactjs-application-with-next-js)".  
Or the "[State Monad in JavaScript](https://egghead.io/courses/state-monad-in-javascript)"

Drawing well is difficult in its own right. Making a dog look like a dog or hand look like a hand requires a lot of training, practice and patience. 
There's a whole extra layer to the challenge when you don't even know what that _thing_ is yet.

Good meaningful illustration works on three layers:
* conceptual metaphor
* clear visual communication
* making it look cool. 

A whole lot of people ask how to make things look cool. Which is a legitimate desire. I am very into making shit look cool.

In fact, a significant number of people will be here hoping to learn what pixel size I set my #EAEFF1 brush to in order to careful render a diffuse light across a reflective metallic surface in Photoshop CC 2020 on a 15-inch Macbook Pro 2015 hooked up to a Wacom Cintiq 22HD running OS Catalina 10.15.1.

<SmallCenter>

![Shiny metallic illustration with an annotated sketch on top pointing to shiny render effects](./EGH_ngrxAngular_424@2x.png)

</SmallCenter>

This is not that blog post. <Tooltip tiptext={<span>If you would like to learn how, take <a href="">Sam Neilson's Fundamentals of Lighting</a> on Schoolism. It will drown you in the minutiae of rendering light on surfaces.<br />Also check out the <a href="https://illustrated.dev/resources">Resources</a> page.</span>}>3</Tooltip>

To get the tool talk out of the way, here's my tech stack:

![A Wacom Cintiq]()
![An iPad Pro]()
![Adobe Photoshop]()
![Adobe Illustrator]()

They are definitely helpful. But they're also the surface level of the Thing We're Doing. Which is learning how to draw invisible things.

Good, now we can get back to talking about the meaty stuff.

## Part One - Making Metaphors

This is instead about Metaphors. Specifically, **Visual Metaphors**.

While much of my work does involve drawing shapes correctly and picking nice colours and rendering lighting effects, those are very much the top layer of the illustration cake. Visual metaphors are the base.

![Illustration of a layered cake with metaphor on the bottom, good drawing foundations in the middle, and colours with pretty lighting effects on the top. And a cherry representing whatever photoshop brush I'm using to make these](./cake.png)

## What's a Metaphor?

The first step to getting good at visual metaphor is understanding what it is.

![Diagram of intangible fuzzy thing through the frame of a physical object](./metaphor.jpeg)

Conceptual metaphor is the basis of how we draw every single non-literal object. Drawing an orange is fairly straight forward. Drawing anything non-physical abstract __thing__ – freedom, financial crashes, racial tension, teamwork, speculation, database management, capitalism, productivity – all relies on metaphor. 


---

Finding the right visual metaphor is a going to be a glorious scavenger hunt through language, iconography, and cultural association.

### Let's look at these again

Part of getting good at visual metaphors is explicitly realising when you're seeing one and working backwards to break down how it's working.

_{Do cake breakdowns of the three egghead illos in a carousel-like set of arrow images. You click through and different cake layers highlight. Makes explicit the conceptual metaphor layer (CSS styles control how specific areas of a website look. abstract away concept of "thing that selects individual areas to change their visual appearance". Could be paint confined to an area - paint by numbers) the clear visual communication layer(image references, clear composition), and the making it look cool layer (point out nice colour palette, light effects)_

_Vue-router - metaphor that routers move you from one area of a website to another. Websites are physical locations we physically move through.}_


<SmallCenter>
CSS selectors = picking specific architectural elements of a house to colour in with a historical throwback to the Sims 2 UI

![](./EGH_CSSSelectors_424@2x.png)


Redux-actions = video game controllers

![](EGH_ReduxActions424@2x.png)


Vue-router = an underground railway system. Pages in an app are stations.

![](VueRouter_424@2x.png)

</SmallCenter>

I know this is a little like telling a joke, and then explaining why the joke was funny. It kind of sucks the fun out of it. But breaking down the visual metaphors behind visuals is one of the best ways I've found to getting better at thinking in them.

You want to backwards engineer how the image works.

I do this every time I see a terribly clever editorial piece on a news or media site, and keep a giant collection of them for reference.

## Let's Get Analytical

Here's a handful of editorial illustration whose work I admire:
