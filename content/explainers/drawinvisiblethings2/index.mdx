## Part Two â€“ Cultural Research

Our first order of business is getting a grip on what this course is about.

Mike's [handy workshop outline](https://github.com/mikesherov/web-security-essentials) 


### Dump All the Ideas

Idea dumping is the best way to ...

What this looks like is a freewheeling list of associated words and concepts.

At this point I open up Procreate on my iPad Pro and create a new blank canvas
It's 4000 x 5000 pixel at 144dpi(2) â€“ this gives me a ton of open space to work in. Nothing worse than running out of imaginary digital paper.

(2) The size and dpi of this canvas make absolutely no difference to the quality of the brainstorming we're about to do but someone is going to ask ðŸ˜‰

I start jotting down all the obvious associations that immediately come to mind: 

- Hacking, the dark web, protection, DDOS, click attacks, man in the middle attacks, honeypot wifi, firewalls, breaching systems, botnets, zero day vulnerabilities, exploits, phishing, malware, ransomware, bitcoin ransoms, spoofing, trojan horses, VPNs, white-grey-black hats, password dumps, password cracking, cryptography, algorithms, cookies

- Picking locks, skeleton keys, lock picking kits, padlocks, bike locks, security shutters, Fingerprints, scanners, secure buildings, swipe cards, lanyards

- Breaking in, breaking glass, smashing windows, disabling, turning off systems, glitches, slipping underneath, blowing it all up, shelter, cover, umbrella, raining attacks

- Castles, bricks, thick walls, moats, scanning the landscape, watch towers, fire, torches, great wall of china, signals, catapults, medieval armoury, forts, 

- Shields, barriers, bullet-proof vests, Knights, swords, horses, jousting, Bow & Arrows, arrows in a shield, robin hood, target practice, nail on the head, arrow in the apple, firing click-arrows, guards, Buckingham palace, the panopticon, gates, wrought iron, monitoring, watching, eyes, police, TSA, metal detectors, CCTV cameras, surveillance, warning signs, lasers, MI5, recording devices

- Immunity â€“ immune system, inflammation, disease, cancer, T cells, viruses, microscope images of bacteria, infections, antibiotics, vaccinations

What we're doing here is laying out **a conceptual map** to explore.

It's pretty good but there's one issue with it.  
It's only _my_ assocations with "Web Security."  
And this illustration isn't for me. It's for _you_.

Maybe you personally.  
But in a generalised sense, the large lovely community that revolves around egghead.io and the world of web development.  
It needs to yell "I am about Web Security!" to everyone that sees it.

This requires cultural research. Which is where this gets fun. 

## Part Three - Cultural Ethnography

If we want to find out the general cultural conceptions around "Web Security," we head to the native watering holes of the internet - Hacker News,reddit, and twitter.
What I'm looking for are overarching cultural tropes, touchstones, and metaphorical language.

[r/cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/)
[r/websecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/websecurity/)

Some things that jump out â€“ "penetration testing" "risk management" "secure field login" "third-party vendors" "XSS" "vulnerability" "injection"

Overall noticing empahsis on entry points like login forms. It's noticing we speak about websites as contained objects that have physical boundaries and vulnerable entryways into that container.
Chinks in the armour. Gatewatys into the fortness. Cracks in the walls. Underground tunnels into mission control. Injections into the human body - our skin is our container.

### Language Analysis

I am a huge nerd for linguistic analysis tools. These are like a thesaurus on steroids.

#### [TV Tropes]()

A quick search on here turned up [security blankets](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecurityBlanket), [overreactive TSA agents](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverreactingAirportSecurity), [laser hallways](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserHallway), and [magical CCTV cams](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSecurityCam)

#### [iWeb English Corpora](https://www.english-corpora.org/iweb/)

First, I'm sorry about this one. Someone built this website back in 1994 and hasn't touched it since.  The UX is a horror show and I only understand 37% of how it works.  That 37% is well worth it though.

// Video voiceover of searching on it. 


At this point I have a very generic form in my mind of some kind of __container__ that has __defined boundaries__ and __vulnerable entry points__

![](./security-container.jpeg)

It's a rough image in my mind but it's a base set of conditions to build a visual metaphor off.

* The human body
* A gated fortress / secure building
* A biological cell
* Locked box

While doing all this research and idea generation I open up a new blank canvas on my iPad and start loosely jotting down all the themes and visual ideas I'm stumbling across. 

![](Initial-sketches.png)

It's words from the idea dummp list, small icons that relate to them

![](first-pass-ideas.png)

All the beginning sketches are quite typical and tropey - padlocks, keyholes, and web browsers. The kind of standard imagery you find by [googling web security]()

This stuff is still important to get down on the page. If this is what jumps to mind for most people it clearly holds strong visual power. A worthwhile base to build off.
