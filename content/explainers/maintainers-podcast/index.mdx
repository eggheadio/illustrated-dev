A few weeks ago I got the chance to chat to <Link to='https://twitter.com/hzoo'>Henry Zhu</Link> on his  <Link to="https://maintainersanonymous.com/">Maintainers Anonymous</Link> podcast.  It's a show about people who maintain things in the world.  Whether it's code, cities, infrastructure, or museum archives, someone has to keep the decks clean and the engine stoked.

I'm not a maintainer (the only thing I reliably maintain is an obsessive tea habit), but I went on to chat to Henry about the overlap between the <Link to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source-software_movement">open source software</Link> and the anthropological theory of <Link to='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy'>gift economies</Link>.

Gift theory, reciprocity, and economic anthropology are all side obsessions of mine. I originally trained as a cultural anthropologist, and it's still an enourmous part of how I understand and operate in the world.  
Like any good cult, once you're indoctrinated you can never leave.

Henry and I began discussing the parallels between gift economies and open source software (OSS) last summer.  

At the time I barely knew anything about OSS. Which made me fairly typical. 99.9% of the world haven't a clue about the rich, dramatic cultural history of Linux, or Xerox PARC, or the browser wars.   Researching the movement has been fascinating and eye opening to say the least.

<p>Henry earned his striped in the OSS world as the core mainainer of <Link to="https://babeljs.io/">Babel.js</Link> - an open-source javascript <Link to="http://illustrated.dev/compilers">transpiler</Link> that's used by the vast majority of javascript-based websites.  

The Babel project, and Henry as its steward, is a fascinating case study in the open source software economy and where it's headed.</p>

It's a wide ranging discussion where we're both thinking out loud and exploring ideas, rather than coming to insightful or profound conclusions. We're doing some follow-up episodes in the coming months as well. <Link to="https://maintainersanonymous.com/">Subscribe to the podcast</Link> if you don't want to miss them.
