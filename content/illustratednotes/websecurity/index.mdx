![Web security essentials - Let's look at three common attacks](./web-security-1.png)

## Man in the Middle

![First, man in the middle is a peice of software that intercepts data between a client and a server](./web-security-2.png)

![If this connection is over HTTP all your data packets are readable cleartext. Anyone on the network can use a packet sniffer to see your data. Instead we use HTTPS to encrypt packets. ](./web-security-6.png)

![How to protect yourself. Use HSTS headers. Require HTTPS everywhere. Redirect HTTP to HTTPS](./web-security-7.png)

## Cross-Site Request Forgery

![Cross-site request forgery is an attack that tricks the user into visiting a malicious site while they're already logged into a trusted site.](./web-security-3.png)

![This is possible because browsers send cookies between sites by default. How to protect yourself. Cookies come with a 'sameSite' property that prevents them from being passed between sites. Set it to 'lax' or 'strict'](./web-security-4.png)

## Cross-Site Scripting

![Cross-site scripting is an attack that injects malicious code into a trusted site. This can happen is the site allows user input to appear on the page without validating or encoding it. Protect yourself with a content security policy which manages which types of resources are allowed to load and where.](./web-security-5.png)
