As part of my everyday [egghead](https://egghead.io) work, I make a lot of notes. Sketchnotes in particular.

Everytime we have a new course in production, I'll watch all the video lessons and sketch out the major points.  
These help me give ideas for illustrations and diagrams we can build on top of the lessons. 

At the moment we've got one in the pipeline by [Brett Cassette](http://twitter.com/brettcassette) all about testing with [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/).

Here's a small preview of it:
