The technical details of how The Internet Pipes move emojis across continents in 0.004 miliseconds is well beyond my paygrade.

Apparently it has something to do with *websockets*  
Which are a brand new concept to me.  

But I got to learn about them this week while taking notes on [Mark Bartons's new course](https://egghead.io/courses/vue-and-socket-io-for-real-time-communication) on building an instant chat app with [Vue.js]() and [Socket.io]()
