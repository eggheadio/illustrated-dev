Being humans, we rarely learn things linearly.  
No one begins their JavaScript journey by reading [the TC39 language specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/) line-by-line like a pedantic masochist.

Instead we all cobble together a good-enough understanding, leaving holes here and there to fill in later.

So far I've stumbled along without 100% grokking prototypical inheritance, or how `call, apply,` and `bind` work on functions.  
It's fine. Stuff mostly works. Until it doesn't  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

But at some point, it's useful to stop stumbling about and  peek back at those holes.

[Tyler Clark](https://twitter.com/iamtylerwclark)'s latest course on [Advanced JavaScript Foundations](https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-javascript-foundations?af=54fd64) is exactly that hole-filling opportunity.

Tyler runs through all the details that usually get skipped over in beginners tutorials.  The ones that make a huge difference when you're deep in a debugging session, and can't figure out where the f🍪🍩k `this` is pointing and why all your results are `undefined`.

<hr />

Here's some of my sketch notes from the course – they include plenty of DNA inheritence metaphors 🧬 and a few cups of caffiene to keep you alert.

<br />

![Advanced JS fundamentals title slide](./AdvancedJS_1@2x.png)

![The primitive types are not objects, have no methods, and can't be mutated.](./AdvancedJS_2@2x.png)

![Prototypes are how we do inheritance in JS. They're linked objects of parents and children that pass down inherited properties. All JS objects are made from a default prototype that includes the __proto__ property](./AdvancedJS_3@2x.png)

![.prototype is different to __proto__. It's a method on a function that points to a constructor object.](./AdvancedJS_5.png)

<br />

![The this keyword points to an object based on the execution context of where a function is called, not where it's defined.](./AdvancedJS_4@2x.png)

<br />

Hopefully these gave you a sense of the main concepts, and a small map of where your own JavaScript 🕳 holes are (or lack of holes if you've already diligently filled them in!)
