If you've been keeping up with the sweetest new static-site generation tools, you'll have heard of the JAMstack.
<h6>And if you haven't, <a target="_blank" href="https://jamstack.wtf/">Jamstack WTF</a> explains it well.</h6>

The TLDR here is that combining Javascript, APIs, and Markup (JAM) makes it easy to build sites that work well across all kinds of devices and data loading speeds. Which, like jam, makes everyone happy.

<hr />

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) are  the power couple of the JAMstack. They're tools built for the task, and a fantastic combination if you're building with JAM for the first time.

[Khaled Garbaya](https://khaledgarbaya.net/) just released [a new egghead course](https://egghead.io/courses/build-content-rich-progressive-web-apps-with-gatsby-and-contentful) that walks you through hooking these two up.

I'm keen on Gatsby since this whole site is built with it. Working through the course filled in quite a few holes I had around it's inner workings.

As usual, I made sure to take notes:

![The JAM stack is a new way to build web apps for speed and scalability. It uses Javascript, APIs, and Markup.](./gatsbycontentful2.png)

![These two work well together - contentful feeds the data into gatsby. You structure all your content inside contentful, which then goes into gatsby through the gatsby-source-contentful plugin.](./gatsbycontentful3.png)

![We can create new pages for our site inside gatsby-node.js. The gatsby node API gives us a creatPage action](./gatsbycontentful4.png)
