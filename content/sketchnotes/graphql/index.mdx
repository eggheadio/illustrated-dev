[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is undoubtably one of the popular kids on the webdev playground this year (alongside [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html)).

If you haven't heard of GraphQL, the TLDR is that it's a new way to request data from an API.  

One that's easier, faster, better, and stronger than the old [RESTful API system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).

<hr />

If you're lucky enough to already grok GraphQL, you'll know the _QL_ stands for _Query Language_ – aka. the language we talk to our GraphQL API in.  

It's not a terribly complex language, but you'll still need to do some syntax studying to get the hang of it.

Thankfully the magnificent [Eve Porcello](https://twitter.com/eveporcello) just released [a new course on egghead](https://egghead.io/courses/graphql-query-language) that runs you through the full GraphQL vocabulary.

<hr />

Here are some of my notes from working through Eve's material:
