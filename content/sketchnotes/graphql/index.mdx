[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is undoubtably one of the popular kids on the webdev playground this year (alongside [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html)).

If you haven't heard of GraphQL, the TLDR is that it's a new way to request data from an API.  

One that's easier, faster, better, and stronger than the old [RESTful API system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).

If you're lucky enough to already grok GraphQL, you'll know the _QL_ stands for _Query Language_ – aka. the language we talk to our GraphQL API in.  

It's not a terribly complex language, but you'll still need to do some syntax studying to get the hang of it.

Thankfully the magnificent [Eve Porcello](https://twitter.com/eveporcello) just released [a new course on egghead](https://egghead.io/courses/graphql-query-language?af=54fd64) that runs you through the full GraphQL vocabulary.

It's a wonderful introduction for anyone new to the GraphQL ecosystem – Eve explains all the parts of the playground interface that are not in the least bit intuitive. I'd been stumbling about in my own GraphQL queries lost and afraid until I worked through this.

Anyways, as usual I drew some things:

![How to talk to a GraphQL API. We can use the graphQL playground to send queries to a GraphQL endpoint. The playground lets us explore our data before making any requests] (./graphql1.png)

![A query is a request for data. We open it with the query keyword and a set of curly braces. Curly braces wrap around a selection and say "go look inside this object." Blank spaces at the end of a line are fields that say "I want his data please." We can also add the 'total' and 'all' keywords in front of any list of objects.](./graphql4.png)

![Inside the playground, ctrl + space is a magic combination that reveals all the available fields of a query] (./graphql2.png)

![We can filter our data by adding arguments to our queries. This means we only get the data we want. We can also use mutations to change the data. This includes creating, updating, and deleting data.] (./graphql3.png)

This is the first sketchnote we're turning into an IRL atoms-and-quarks poster on [egghead's swag store](https://store.egghead.io/).
