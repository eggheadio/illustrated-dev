[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is undoubtably one of the popular kids on the webdev playground this year (alongside [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html)).

If you haven't heard of GraphQL, the TLDR is that it's a new way to request data from an API.  

One that's easier, faster, better, and stronger than the old [RESTful API system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).

<hr />

If you're lucky enough to already grok GraphQL, you'll know the _QL_ stands for _Query Language_ – aka. the language we talk to our GraphQL API in.  

It's not a terribly complex language, but you'll still need to do some syntax studying to get the hang of it.

Thankfully the magnificent [Eve Porcello](https://twitter.com/eveporcello) just released [a new course on egghead](https://egghead.io/courses/graphql-query-language) that runs you through the full GraphQL vocabulary.

<hr />

Here are some of my notes from working through Eve's material:

![How to talk to a GraphQL API. We can use the graphQL playground to send queries to a GraphQL endpoint. The playground lets us explore our data before making any requests] (./graphql1.png)

![Inside the playground, ctrl + space is a magic combination that reveals all the available fields of a query] (./graphql2.png)

![We can filter our data by adding arguments to our queries. This means we only get the data we want. We can also use mutations to change the data. This includes creating, updating, and deleting data.] (./graphql3.png)
