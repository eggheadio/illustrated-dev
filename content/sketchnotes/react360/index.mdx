Turns out you can build almost anything in React now... including VR and AR apps inside a web browser.

There's a version of React called '[React 360](https://facebook.github.io/react-360/)' that simplifies the otherwise niche and overly-complex challenge of making things fly around in virtual 3D space.

[Tomasz Lakomy](https://egghead.io/instructors/tomasz-lakomy) is putting together an egghead course all about it.

So I've been sketching out notes on some of the basic concepts while watching his lessons.

![Uses flexbox for layouts. On the web it flexes across rows by default. But in VR it flexes downwards in a stacked columns. To add CSS styles to our views, we make a special React 360 stylesheet and then we pass them to the style tag.](./react360_p3@2x.png)

![Add 3D models to your components with the Entity tag. We can apply CSS transforms to these.](./react360_p4@2x.png)

Want to learn more?
A high-res version of the sketchnote plus the full [VR Applications Using React360](https://egghead.io/courses/vr-applications-using-react-360?rc=272bjb) course will be out soon. Best to keep an eye on that page if it's a topic you're into.
