Earlier this year I was lucky enough to attend the [ReactJS Girls Conference](https://reactjsgirls.com/) here in London.  
As you might have guessed, it involved a lot of React and a lot of great female speakers.


While listening to [Manjula Dube](https://twitter.com/manjula_dube?lang=en) explain React hooks, and [Marcy Sutton](https://marcysutton.com/) walk us through making React components accessible, I spent the day doodling flying components and functions and props on my iPad.

I always enjoy fun-drawing at conferences where I'm just an attendee, and not there as an official sketchnoter (something I occasionally do professionally).

These aren't well-crafted summaries of the content.  
They're just a product of me relaxing while listening.  
Though they loosely relate to what's happening on stage.
